## Issue 18: LiveStore server-to-client sync

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Establish real-time sync between the server and client LiveStore instances over WebSocket. Events committed on the server should appear on the client and vice versa. This is the reactive backbone of the entire app.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] WebSocket endpoint on server for LiveStore sync (SyncRpcLive at /rpc — Issue #18)
- [x] Client connects and syncs on startup (makeWsSync in worker with Blocking initial sync — Issue #18)
- [x] Event committed on server → appears on client within reasonable latency (via Push → broadcast to live Pull subscribers — Issue #18)
- [x] Event committed on client → appears on server (via client Push → server stores in SQLite — Issue #18)
- [x] Handles reconnection on disconnect (built into makeWsSync via Effect RPC WebSocket transport — Issue #18)
- [ ] Tests: server commits event → client receives; client commits event → server receives; disconnect + reconnect → state consistent (deferred — requires running both server and web app)

## Issue 19: @effect/rpc server router setup

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Create the `@effect/rpc` server router infrastructure in `packages/server/src/rpc/`. Use `RpcServer` to handle the `LaborerRpcs` group from `packages/shared`. Mount it on the Bun HTTP server with WebSocket support (for `RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` on the client) and `RpcSerialization.layerJson`. Establish the pattern for adding new RPC handlers: each handler is implemented via `RpcGroup.toHandlers` and delegates to an Effect service, committing state changes to LiveStore.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] RPC server handles all `LaborerRpcs` methods via `RpcServer` over HTTP (implemented in Issue #12)
- [x] `RpcSerialization.layerNdjson` configured for NDJSON serialization (implemented in Issue #12)
- [x] Unknown RPC methods return a proper error response (handled by RpcServer automatically)
- [x] Handler pattern is composable (new handlers added via `LaborerRpcs.toLayer` + `LaborerRpcs.of`)
- [ ] Tests: registered method → responds; unknown method → error; malformed request → error (deferred — vitest not yet configured)

## Issue 20: AtomRpc client setup (effect-atom)

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Set up the `@effect-atom/atom-react` RPC client in `apps/web/src/atoms/`. Create a `LaborerClient` class using `AtomRpc.Tag` that wraps the `LaborerRpcs` group from `packages/shared`. Configure it with `RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` over `BrowserSocket.layerWebSocket` pointing to the server URL (from env). Components can then use `LaborerClient.mutation("rpcName")` with `useAtomSet` for actions, and `LaborerClient.query("rpcName", payload)` with `useAtomValue` for queries.

Example:
```ts
import { AtomRpc } from "@effect-atom/atom-react"
import { BrowserSocket } from "@effect/platform-browser"
import { RpcClient, RpcSerialization } from "@effect/rpc"
import { LaborerRpcs } from "@laborer/shared/rpc"

class LaborerClient extends AtomRpc.Tag<LaborerClient>()("LaborerClient", {
  group: LaborerRpcs,
  protocol: RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket({
    retryTransientErrors: true,
  }).pipe(
    Layer.provide(BrowserSocket.layerWebSocket(env.VITE_SERVER_URL)),
    Layer.provide(RpcSerialization.layerJson),
  ),
}) {}
```

Verify end-to-end by querying the health check from the UI using `useAtomValue(LaborerClient.query("health", void 0))`.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] `LaborerClient` defined using `AtomRpc.Tag` with `LaborerRpcs` group
- [x] HTTP protocol configured with server URL via same-origin `/rpc`
- [x] `LaborerClient.mutation` and `LaborerClient.query` work from React components via `useAtomSet`/`useAtomValue`
- [x] Health check query from web app renders server status
- [ ] Tests: client queries health check → receives response; server down → error handled gracefully (deferred — requires running both server and web app)

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

On server shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM), iterate all running terminals and kill them. Ensure no orphan PTY processes remain.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Shutdown signal → all PTY processes terminated (TerminalManager finalizer iterates all in-memory terminals and kills each via PtyHostClient; PtyHostClient finalizer kills the PTY Host child process)
- [x] No orphan processes after shutdown (belt-and-suspenders: finalizer kills at shutdown + stale terminal cleanup on next startup)
- [ ] Tests: spawn terminals → shutdown → all processes gone (deferred — vitest not yet configured; manual verification: SIGINT triggers finalizer logs)

## Issue 130: Graceful shutdown — free all ports

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

On server shutdown, free all allocated ports in the PortAllocator. This is mostly for clean accounting since the ports are not OS-level reserved, but it ensures consistent state.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Shutdown → all ports marked as freed
- [ ] Restart → port range fully available
- [ ] Tests: allocate ports → shutdown → restart → all ports available

## Issue 131: Theme consistency audit

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Audit all custom components (terminal chrome, diff viewer, panel dividers, status badges) to ensure they use shadcn/ui theme tokens consistently. No hard-coded colors. Dark mode works throughout. Visual integration between terminal panes, diff viewers, and panel chrome should be seamless.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All custom components use oklch theme variables (no hard-coded hex/rgb)
- [ ] Dark mode renders correctly across all components
- [ ] Terminal background matches app theme
- [ ] Diff viewer colors complement the theme
- [ ] Panel dividers and chrome are visually consistent
- [ ] Tests: visual audit / snapshot tests; toggle theme → all components update

## Issue 132: terminal.remove RPC handler + TerminalManager delete

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Add a `terminal.remove` RPC method to the `LaborerRpcs` contract and implement it on the server. When a terminal is in "stopped" status, this method removes it from the TerminalManager's in-memory tracking, commits a `TerminalRemoved` event to LiveStore (deleting the row from the Terminals table), and cleans up any panel pane references that pointed to that terminal. If the terminal is still running, it should be killed first before removal. This completes the terminal lifecycle: spawn -> (optionally kill/stop) -> remove.

On the UI side, add a "Remove" / delete button to stopped terminals in the terminal list (Issue #63). Clicking it calls `LaborerClient.mutation("terminal.remove")` via `useAtomSet`. The terminal disappears from the list and any pane displaying it reverts to an empty state.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] `terminal.remove` added to `LaborerRpcs` in `packages/shared/src/rpc.ts` with `Rpc.make("terminal.remove", { payload: TerminalRemovePayload })`
- [x] `TerminalRemovePayload` schema defined with `terminalId` field
- [x] `TerminalManager.remove(terminalId)` method implemented — kills PTY if still running, removes from in-memory map
- [x] `TerminalRemoved` event added to LiveStore schema, materializer deletes terminal row from Terminals table
- [x] Server RPC handler delegates to TerminalManager.remove and commits TerminalRemoved event
- [x] Removing a nonexistent terminal returns a descriptive error
- [x] UI: delete/remove button visible on stopped terminals in the terminal list
- [x] UI: button calls `LaborerClient.mutation("terminal.remove")` via `useAtomSet`
- [x] UI: terminal disappears from list after removal (via LiveStore sync)
- [ ] UI: any pane assigned to the removed terminal shows empty state (deferred — requires panel layout tree cleanup)
- [ ] Tests: remove stopped terminal -> gone from LiveStore and in-memory map; remove running terminal -> killed then removed; remove nonexistent -> error; UI button -> mutation called, terminal gone from list (deferred — vitest not yet configured)

## Issue 133: terminal.restart RPC handler + TerminalManager restart

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Add a `terminal.restart` RPC method to the `LaborerRpcs` contract and implement it on the server. This method kills the existing PTY process for a terminal, then respawns it with the same command in the same workspace directory. The terminal ID remains the same (the LiveStore row is updated, not deleted and recreated), so any pane displaying the terminal continues to show it seamlessly. The terminal status transitions: running -> stopped -> running. A `TerminalRestarted` event is committed to LiveStore, and the scrollback buffer is cleared in xterm.js on the client side.

On the UI side, add a "Restart" button to terminals in the terminal list (both running and stopped). Clicking it calls `LaborerClient.mutation("terminal.restart")` via `useAtomSet`. The xterm.js pane clears and shows the fresh terminal output.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] `terminal.restart` added to `LaborerRpcs` in `packages/shared/src/rpc.ts` with `Rpc.make("terminal.restart", { payload: TerminalRestartPayload })`
- [x] `TerminalRestartPayload` schema defined with `terminalId` field
- [x] `TerminalManager.restart(terminalId)` method implemented — kills existing PTY (if running), respawns with same command and workspace directory, reuses terminal ID
- [x] `TerminalRestarted` event added to LiveStore schema, materializer resets terminal status to "running"
- [x] Server RPC handler delegates to TerminalManager.restart and commits TerminalRestarted event
- [x] Restarting a nonexistent terminal returns a descriptive error
- [x] Restarting a stopped terminal respawns it (acts as a "start again")
- [x] UI: restart button visible on terminals in the terminal list (both running and stopped)
- [x] UI: button calls `LaborerClient.mutation("terminal.restart")` via `useAtomSet`
- [x] UI: xterm.js clears scrollback on restart and shows fresh output
- [ ] Tests: restart running terminal -> killed then respawned, same ID, status = running; restart stopped terminal -> respawned; restart nonexistent -> error; UI button -> mutation called, terminal output refreshes (deferred — vitest not yet configured)

## Issue 134: Drag terminal from sidebar onto empty panel pane

### Parent PRD

PRD.md

### What to build

Add drag-and-drop support so users can drag a terminal item from the sidebar terminal list onto an empty panel pane to assign that terminal to that pane. Currently, clicking a terminal in the sidebar auto-finds an empty pane or creates a new split — there is no way to target a specific pane. This feature gives users precise control over which pane displays which terminal.

**Drag source**: Make each `TerminalItem` in the terminal list (`apps/web/src/components/terminal-list.tsx`) draggable, carrying `{ terminalId, workspaceId }` as drag data.

**Drop target**: Make empty `LeafNode` panes in `PaneContent` (`apps/web/src/panels/panel-manager.tsx`) accept drops. An empty pane is a `LeafNode` with `paneType: "terminal"` and no `terminalId` set. When an empty pane receives a drop, it should fill the entire pane with that terminal — no splitting required.

**Assignment action**: Use the existing `panelActions.assignTerminalToPane(terminalId, workspaceId, paneId)` which already supports targeted pane assignment via the `paneId` parameter. The plumbing exists; only the drag-and-drop UI needs to be built.

**Visual feedback**: Show a visual drop indicator (highlight border, background tint) on valid drop targets when dragging. Show a "not allowed" indicator on panes that already have content assigned.

A lightweight DnD library (e.g., `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/utilities`) or the native HTML5 Drag and Drop API should be used. Prefer `@dnd-kit` for accessibility (keyboard-based drag) and better React integration.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Terminal items in the sidebar terminal list are draggable (mouse and keyboard)
- [ ] Empty panel panes (LeafNode with no terminalId) are valid drop targets
- [ ] Dropping a terminal onto an empty pane calls `assignTerminalToPane(terminalId, workspaceId, paneId)` — terminal fills the pane
- [ ] Panes that already have a terminal assigned are not valid drop targets (or show a "replace" indicator)
- [ ] Visual drag feedback: dragged item has a drag preview, drop targets highlight on drag-over
- [ ] Layout is persisted to LiveStore after drop (via existing `layoutPaneAssigned` event flow)
- [ ] Dragging does not interfere with existing click-to-assign behavior in the sidebar
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility: drag-and-drop can be performed via keyboard (if using @dnd-kit)
- [ ] Tests: drag terminal onto empty pane → terminal renders in that pane; drag onto occupied pane → rejected or replaced; layout persisted after drop; click-to-assign still works

## Issue 135: Remove base64 encoding from PTY IPC

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Remove the unnecessary base64 encoding layer from the PTY host IPC protocol. The PTY host currently base64-encodes every output chunk before wrapping it in JSON, and the server decodes it on the other side. Since node-pty's `onData` produces UTF-8 strings and JSON natively supports UTF-8 with proper escaping, the base64 step is unnecessary and inflates data by 33%. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Remove Base64 Encoding from IPC" section.

In the PTY host script (`pty-host.ts`), change the `data` event emission from `Buffer.from(data, "utf-8").toString("base64")` to emitting the raw UTF-8 string directly in the JSON `data` field. In `PtyHostClient`, remove the corresponding `Buffer.from(base64Data, "base64").toString("utf-8")` decode step from the data callback routing. In `TerminalManager`, the data callback now receives plain UTF-8 strings — update any consumers accordingly.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] PTY host emits raw UTF-8 strings in the `data` field of IPC `data` events (no base64)
- [x] PtyHostClient no longer base64-decodes incoming data events
- [x] TerminalManager data callback receives plain UTF-8 strings
- [x] Existing PTY host integration tests pass with the new encoding (update assertions)
- [x] Terminal output fidelity unchanged: ANSI escape sequences, Unicode, and control characters transport correctly via JSON escaping
- [x] Tests: spawn a process that outputs colors + Unicode → verify output arrives correctly without base64

## Issue 136: IPC buffer optimization (O(n²) → array accumulator)

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Replace the O(n²) string concatenation pattern in both the PTY host's stdin line reader and the PtyHostClient's stdout line reader with an array-based accumulator. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Buffer Optimization" section.

Both readers currently use `buffer += chunk` followed by repeated `.indexOf('\n')` and `.slice()` calls. Under high throughput, this creates significant garbage collection pressure because each concatenation copies the entire accumulated string. Replace with: push incoming chunks onto an array, join only when scanning for newlines or draining, and keep the remainder as a single-element array.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] PTY host stdin reader uses array-based accumulator instead of `buffer += chunk`
- [ ] PtyHostClient stdout reader uses array-based accumulator instead of `buffer += chunk`
- [ ] No behavioral change — line-delimited JSON parsing works identically
- [ ] Existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Tests: high-throughput scenario (e.g., `seq 1 10000`) completes without excessive GC pauses

## Issue 137: PTY data coalescing (5ms timer)

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Add a 5ms coalescing timer per PTY instance in the PTY host, matching VS Code's `TerminalDataBufferer` pattern. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Data Coalescing in the PTY Host" section.

When `pty.onData` fires: if no buffer exists for that PTY, create one (an array of strings) and start a 5ms `setTimeout`. If a buffer already exists, push the data onto it. When the timer fires, join all buffered strings, emit a single `data` event, and delete the buffer. This reduces the number of IPC messages by an order of magnitude for burst output while adding imperceptible latency for interactive typing.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Each PTY instance in the PTY host has an independent coalescing buffer (`coalesceBuffers` Map keyed by PTY id)
- [x] Rapid output (multiple `onData` calls within 5ms) produces a single coalesced IPC `data` event (verified by test — `seq 1 1000` produces < 200 events)
- [x] Interactive typing (single characters > 5ms apart) still produces individual events after a 5ms delay
- [x] Tests: run `seq 1 1000` → count `data` events received, verify significantly fewer than 1000 (proving coalescing)
- [x] Tests: verify resize flushes pending coalesced data before applying resize

## Issue 138: Ring buffer data structure + unit tests

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Implement a ring buffer (circular buffer) data structure as a standalone module in the server package. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Server-Side Ring Buffer for Scrollback" section.

The ring buffer uses a `Uint8Array` with a configurable capacity (default 1MB) and a write cursor that wraps around when full. It supports writing UTF-8 encoded bytes and reading the current contents (from oldest to newest, handling the wrap-around correctly). This module is used by TerminalManager to provide scrollback on WebSocket reconnection.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] Ring buffer module exported from server package (`packages/server/src/lib/ring-buffer.ts`)
- [x] `write(data: Uint8Array)` appends data, wrapping when capacity is reached
- [x] `read(): Uint8Array` returns current contents from oldest to newest
- [x] `clear()` resets the buffer
- [x] `size` property returns current byte count (capped at capacity)
- [x] Tests: write less than capacity → read returns written data (32 tests total)
- [x] Tests: write more than capacity → read returns only the last `capacity` bytes (correct wrap-around)
- [x] Tests: write exactly capacity → read returns all data
- [x] Tests: write zero bytes → no-op
- [x] Tests: empty buffer → read returns empty Uint8Array
- [x] Tests: sequential writes and reads produce correct results

## Issue 139: Terminal WebSocket endpoint + server ring buffer integration

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Create the dedicated terminal WebSocket endpoint and integrate the ring buffer into TerminalManager. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Dedicated Terminal WebSocket Endpoint" and "Server-Side Ring Buffer for Scrollback" sections.

Add a new HTTP route at `GET /terminal?id=<terminalId>` that upgrades to a WebSocket connection. TerminalManager gains a 1MB ring buffer per active terminal and a subscriber management system. When a WebSocket client connects: validate the terminal exists, send ring buffer contents as scrollback, then subscribe to live output. When the client sends text frames, forward to PTY as input (non-JSON text) or handle ack messages (JSON with `type: "ack"`). When the client disconnects, unsubscribe. When the terminal exits, send final output and close the WebSocket with status 1000.

Update the Vite dev proxy in `apps/web/vite.config.ts` to route `/terminal` WebSocket connections to the backend.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `GET /terminal?id=<terminalId>` upgrades to WebSocket
- [ ] Connecting to a valid, running terminal succeeds
- [ ] Connecting to a nonexistent terminal ID → WebSocket closes with error
- [ ] On connect, ring buffer contents (scrollback) sent as text frames
- [ ] Live terminal output forwarded as text frames to all connected WebSocket clients
- [ ] Text frames from client forwarded to PTY as input via PtyHostClient.write()
- [ ] Client disconnect → unsubscribe from output, no resource leak
- [ ] Terminal exit → final output sent, WebSocket closed with 1000
- [ ] Ring buffer retained after terminal exit (until terminal is removed)
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous WebSocket connections to the same terminal work independently
- [ ] Vite proxy routes `/terminal` to backend with WebSocket support
- [ ] Tests: connect → receive scrollback + live output; send input → echoed back; disconnect → clean; reconnect → scrollback replayed

## Issue 140: Web client terminal pane: WebSocket data path

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Replace the TerminalPane's LiveStore event subscription with a direct WebSocket connection to the new `/terminal` endpoint. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Web Client Terminal Pane Update" section.

On mount (when a terminal ID is available), open a WebSocket to `/terminal?id=<terminalId>`. On message, write data directly to xterm.js via `terminal.write(event.data)`. On keypress, send the keystroke as a WebSocket text frame (replaces `terminal.write` RPC call for interactive input). On unmount, close the WebSocket cleanly. On WebSocket error/close, display a disconnection indicator and attempt reconnection with exponential backoff.

The `terminal.write` RPC continues to work alongside WebSocket for programmatic input (e.g., agent automation). `terminal.resize` remains an RPC call.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] TerminalPane opens WebSocket to `/terminal?id=<terminalId>` on mount (via `useTerminalWebSocket` hook)
- [x] Terminal output received via WebSocket is written directly to xterm.js (via `onData` callback)
- [x] Keystrokes sent as WebSocket text frames (not RPC) (via `wsSendRef.current(data)`)
- [x] Page reload → WebSocket reconnects, scrollback from ring buffer displayed (server sends ring buffer as initial text frames)
- [x] WebSocket disconnect → visual indicator shown in terminal pane (red `DisconnectedBanner`)
- [x] Reconnection with exponential backoff on WebSocket close/error (500ms initial, 30s max, 2x factor)
- [x] `terminal.write` RPC still works for programmatic input (unchanged on server side)
- [x] `terminal.resize` RPC still works for resize (kept as-is in TerminalPane)
- [x] Remove or disable the LiveStore `store.events()` subscription for terminal output (replaced with WebSocket)
- [ ] Tests: type in terminal → output appears (end-to-end); reload page → scrollback visible; disconnect → indicator shown (deferred — requires running both server and web app)

## Issue 141: Character-count flow control (server side)

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Implement VS Code's character-count flow control model in the PTY host and wire it through PtyHostClient. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Character-Count Flow Control" section.

In the PTY host: track `unacknowledgedCharCount` per PTY. Each emitted `data` event increases it by the character count. When it exceeds `HighWatermarkChars` (100,000), call `pty.pause()`. Add a new `{ type: "ack", id, chars }` IPC command that decrements `unacknowledgedCharCount`. When it drops below `LowWatermarkChars` (5,000), call `pty.resume()`. Emit `{ type: "paused", id }` and `{ type: "resumed", id }` debug events.

In PtyHostClient: add an `ack(id: string, chars: number)` method that sends the ack command to the PTY host.

In the terminal WebSocket endpoint: when a client sends an ack JSON frame, forward it to PtyHostClient.ack(). When a client disconnects, reset flow control state (resume PTY if paused, clear unacknowledged count) to prevent stuck PTYs.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] PTY host tracks `unacknowledgedCharCount` per PTY
- [ ] PTY paused when unacknowledged chars exceed 100,000
- [ ] PTY resumed when unacknowledged chars drop below 5,000 (after ack)
- [ ] `{ type: "ack", id, chars }` IPC command implemented and handled
- [ ] PtyHostClient exposes `ack(id, chars)` method
- [ ] `paused` and `resumed` debug events emitted for observability
- [ ] WebSocket endpoint forwards ack frames to PtyHostClient
- [ ] Client disconnect → PTY resumed, ack count cleared
- [ ] Tests: produce fast output without acks → PTY pauses (output rate plateaus or `paused` event observed)
- [ ] Tests: send acks → PTY resumes, output continues
- [ ] Tests: disconnect client → PTY not stuck in paused state

## Issue 142: Client-side flow control acks

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Implement client-side character counting and ack frame sending in the TerminalPane WebSocket connection. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Web Client Terminal Pane Update" section (point 4).

The client tracks total characters received from the WebSocket. Every `CharCountAckSize` (5,000) characters processed, it sends an ack text frame: `{"type":"ack","chars":5000}`. This completes the flow control loop: PTY host → server → client → ack → server → PTY host.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] TerminalPane tracks characters received from WebSocket
- [ ] Ack frame sent every 5,000 characters: `{"type":"ack","chars":5000}`
- [ ] Acks sent as JSON text frames distinguishable from regular input
- [ ] Flow control loop works end-to-end: fast output → PTY pauses → client processes + sends acks → PTY resumes
- [ ] Tests: produce continuous output → verify ack frames sent at regular intervals; verify output is not permanently blocked

## Issue 143: Deprecate terminalOutput from LiveStore hot path

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Stop committing `v1.TerminalOutput` events to LiveStore on the server's terminal data path. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "LiveStore Schema Changes" section.

In TerminalManager, remove the `store.commit(events.terminalOutput(...))` call from the PTY data callback. Terminal output now flows exclusively through the dedicated WebSocket. Keep the `terminalOutput` event definition and materializer in the schema for backward compatibility with any existing eventlog data (it already has a no-op materializer: `() => []`).

Terminal lifecycle events (`terminalSpawned`, `terminalStatusChanged`, `terminalKilled`, `terminalRemoved`, `terminalRestarted`) remain as synced events in LiveStore.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] TerminalManager no longer commits `terminalOutput` events to LiveStore
- [x] `terminalOutput` event definition kept in schema (marked as deprecated via comment)
- [x] Terminal lifecycle events still committed to LiveStore and synced correctly
- [x] LiveStore sync initialization does not break when `terminalOutput` events stop appearing
- [x] Server memory usage lower under sustained terminal output (no SQLite writes per output chunk)
- [x] Tests: all 46 existing tests pass without modification (spawn terminal output now flows via WebSocket only)

## Issue 144: Resize flushes coalesced buffer + flow control reset on disconnect

### Parent PRD

PRD-terminal-perf.md

### What to build

Handle two edge cases in the coalescing and flow control systems. Reference PRD-terminal-perf.md "Data Coalescing in the PTY Host" (resize flush) and "Dedicated Terminal WebSocket Endpoint" (connection lifecycle point 6) sections.

**Resize flush**: When the PTY host receives a `resize` command, immediately flush any pending coalesced buffer for that PTY before applying the resize. This ensures output is associated with the correct terminal dimensions, matching VS Code's behavior.

**Disconnect flow control reset**: When a WebSocket client disconnects, the server must reset flow control state for that terminal: resume the PTY if paused and clear the `unacknowledgedCharCount`. This prevents the PTY from getting stuck in a paused state when there are no consumers. If other WebSocket clients are still connected, flow control continues with them.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Resize command in PTY host flushes pending coalesced buffer for that PTY immediately
- [ ] Flushed data emitted as a `data` event before the resize is applied
- [ ] WebSocket disconnect → PTY resumed if paused, unacknowledged count cleared
- [ ] If multiple clients connected, disconnect of one does not reset flow control (other clients still consuming)
- [ ] Tests: buffer data via coalescing, send resize → buffered data emitted before resize takes effect
- [ ] Tests: pause PTY via flow control, disconnect client → PTY resumes; reconnect → output flows again
